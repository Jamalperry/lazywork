        <h3></br>30.</br> I went by the field of the lazy man, And by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding and common sense; </br>31.</br> And, behold, it was all overgrown with thorns, And nettles were covering its surface, And its stone wall was broken down. </br>32.</br> When I saw, I considered it well; I looked and received instruction. </br>33.</br> “Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest [and daydream],” </br>34.</br> Then your poverty will come as a robber, And your want like an armed man.

          <dt>1. His personal description (v30)</dt>
          <dd>He is slothful and ignorant, and without courage or mental powers to make proper decisions about work and to carry them out.</dd>
       
            
          <dt>2. His circumstances (v30-31)</dt>
          <dd>He has a vineyard and a farm capable of producing his own food and prospering him.</dd>
      
            
          <dt>3. The condition of his farm (v31)</dt>
          <dd>It is grown over with thorns and nettles and the fences are broken down. The whole place is in a ruined state through long neglect.</dd>
      
           
          <dt>4. The cause (v30, 33)</dt>
          <dd>He is too lazy to prune the vineyard; clean up, plow and plant his field; or to repair the fences and the residence. He spends his time in sleep and neglect of essential duties.</dd>
       
       
         <dt>5. The result (v34)</dt>
         <dd>Absolute poverty as one who travels and has spent his last money, and as one who becomes impoverished through warfare.
         </dd>
         
         <dt>6. The lesson learned (v32, 34)</dt>
         <dd>To follow the example of the slothful is to come to the same end.</dd>
